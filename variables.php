// Assignment operation
// Assign (=) a value (32) to the initialized variable ($age)
// It's recommended to assign a default value to an initialized variable even though you'll change this value later
$age = 32;

// THis language is loosly typed, you can initialize a variable without declaring its data type and assigned to any value, and could be changed later

// echo $age;
